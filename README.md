# ZombieSlash
 A Simple Zombie Shooter

# Announcement
 Hello my dear ZombieSlash Players,
 I plan to work from now again on the Game.
 In the next weeks I want to rewrite the Project in many Parts.
 But I plan on adding the following features:
  - A working Weapon System
  - Enemies(Finally)
  - A good Map
  - Multiplayer(Maybe)
  - A complete Overhaul of the Player System

 But no gurantees yet!

 That would it be with this Announcement, thanks for reading!
